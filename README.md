# Giko
This is just a really simple e-commerce app built using React.js and Firebase's Firestore to manage and store data.
<br/>
The app allows the user to browse the shop's items and see their detail (all items or sorted by categoty). After that the user can add a certain quantity to the cart and keep looking for more items to add.
<br />
Finally, at any moment, the user can access their shopping cart by clicking on the button in the navbar. That will show the current items that are inside the cart. Next, the user must fill some contact info and place the order. A message will pop-up and will show a success message and the order code, which the user can copy and proceed to browse more items if he wishes to.

## External Libraries
This project only uses 1 external library called **react-icons**. Everything else was just JSX and CSS styling.

## Try it out
If you'd like to try this app please feel free to contact me through Github and I'll enable the firestore db.

# Create-react-app Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
